I. Description of Project:

Project Name: MineSmarter

This project will be a replication of the classic video game Minesweeper, with some added features that will make the game more enjoyable for the user. 
The game will have the Minesweeper grid visible on the screen, where the user can click on cells of the board. 
Each cell is either a mine, or a safe cell that displays a count of the number of neighboring cells that are mines. 
The goal of the game is to click on all the safe cells and mark all the mines on the board without clicking on a mine. 

However, one key feature is that the user will have an AI available that will always make the optimal move given the state of the board. 
The user can turn to the AI for help in making the best move, and the AI will have a high chance of winning the game for the user. 

User can save/load games, as well as set levels of difficulty related to how much they would like to use the AI.
Scores are the times the user takes to solve the game, and a list of all local best times are displayed during gameplay. 

Rich UI interface along with smart gameplay allows for an enjoyable experience while playing a classic computer game. 


II. How to run the project:

To run the project, simply run 'main.py' inside the code folder in a code editor. 

III. Libraries that need to be installed:

Aside from the CMU_Graphics package, all other libraries are Python builtin libraries. 


IV. Shortcut Commands:

1. When the game starts, press 'space' to start the game. 
2. During game play, if the AI is making a random move, press 'y' to confirm the random move or 'n' to make your own move.

All other gameplay actions involve clicking the buttons on the screen.
